# Hello-World
Super new to the scene, just now learning JAVA after responsive webdev.

Some forums suggested starting to use GitHub from now so I'm just going through their walkthrough.

My name is Neikoli Augustine and I am:
- An almost 30 year old male homonid
- Passionate about business and appearantly coding
- I am currently single with no intentions to mingle
- After God and family, work comes third. Love life comes in at a hard 5th sometime on the weekends
